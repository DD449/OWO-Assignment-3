								<h2 class="major">Eric Chau (s3920350)</h2>
								<p>I’m a 23-year-old Chinese/Vietnamese student who was born and raised in the beautiful city of Melbourne. I spend most of my time playing video games or working out. The game that I am heavily playing is League of Legends, (whether it’s for enjoyment or just out of addiction is up to you) when I’m not playing LoL I generally enjoy playing action RPGs. When games aren’t on the top of my mind, I’m usually working out. I spend 4 days a week training as I am a competitive powerlifter. A sport where contestants compete for the largest total in the squat, bench, and deadlift. My main interest in IT began in 2012, when I was able to build my own PC which I have only just recently upgraded. I also find enjoyment in picking parts and building PCs for my friends and family. Just recently though, a lot of my interest in IT has stemmed from AI and how a lot of what we use today have AI integration without us thinking about it. Studying at RMIT will in hopes lead me in a direction with the right skillset and mindset once graduating university. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Jacob Conley (s3583306)</h2>
								<p> My background is Australian. I like to play games in particular League of Legends, draw and create with digital creation software. My interest in IT had been developed from a young age admittedly on front-end programs to create like Maya, Adobe Creative Suite and Unity. Recently I have had the desire to continue learning about more back-end technologies in IT and develop my overall knowledge further. I have studied experience of a Cert IV in IT and a Diploma of Interactive media but overall, it's limited and needs to be developed further hence the interest in IT. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Karanvir Manan (s3905930)</h2>
								<p> My name is Karanvir Singh Manan(S3905930). I am studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I grew up in the state of Punjab in northern India and moved to Australia in 2016. I graduated from Melton Secondary College in 2020. I am fluent in Punjabi, Hindi, and English. I can get very motivated and very lazy depending on my mood. My hobbies are sketching, soccer and listening to music. I got interested in technology when I was around 10 years old, when my father bought me a Tetris game. Fascinated by the game I grew more interested in games and have continued to play games. In high school I learned coding and it answered many of my questions, so I decided to learn more about IT. </p>
								
								<img src="images/me.PNG" alt="Danny Selfie" class="image">
								<h2 class="major">Danny Nguyen (s3900170)</h2>
								<p> Hi, my name is Danny Nguyen. I am currently 18 years old and taking part in a Bachelors of IT at RMIT. My student Number is S3900170. My background is Vietnamese but I am an Australian citizen. I like to play games, go to the gym , work and listen to music as my hobbies. I love computers, computers are like  toys, fun to play with and makes you happy overall. IT has many different aspects to it but what I like about it is the computer system side to it, like figuring out what PC designs are good. There are so many ways you can build a PC, from small to big or from cheap to expensive. There is so much that PC hardware can do and on top of that IT is the future of society as we are reliant on IT nowadays. I can’t wait to explore future PC hardware because there is so much to offer with creativity building, it’s like creating your own recipe! Studying a bachelors of IT at RMIT will help me focus on becoming a Technician to help with PC hardware. I So far know how to do a bit of coding with python and PC hardware in terms of Bit coding/Hardware. Hoping I can grow my knowledge to become a better IT Technician.</p>
								
								<img src="images/Ghania.JPG" alt="Ghania Selfie" class="image">
								<h2 class="major">Ghania Tariq (s3789307)</h2>
								<p> My name is Ghania Tariq, and I am a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Business (Accounting) at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. I was born and raised in Pakistan, then in 2016 I came to Australia. I completed my secondary school in Pakistan before moving to Australia to pursue my higher studies. Painting is one of my favourite hobbies, and I also enjoy listening to music, photography and visiting new places. In terms of languages, I can communicate in English, Urdu, Hindi, Punjabi, and can read Arabic. At first I thought I’ll do some business only related course and it just struck me back then how I always wanted to know how all these application in any mobile device work or how exactly a computer operates and I should not only train myself to be good in the business side but also the technology point of view, and other major things that gave me an idea of opting for a business course combined with IT touch in it and that’s exactly how my interest in IT field expanded. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Project Description</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Final.PNG" alt="Logo" /></span>
								<p>‘Sports Hub’ is an application that assists people in finding various public sporting areas. The type of areas it will include will be, football ovals, soccer pitches, tennis courts and basketball courts and the App will be able to give you directions/information to each public sporting area. This is to promote the use of public sporting areas and get people to socialise through common interests. It does this by helping a user find Clubs and/or Coaches for their desired sports.</p>
								<p>Joining a Club will allow you to be part of an official club that participates regularly and participant in entry level programs for each sport. You can find a club by a browse function where you search for it using a search bar that matches the words to appropriate teams or if a user is unsure but really wants to participate in a sport they can use a fun quiz inside the app in order to be matched to a club and a sport. </p>
								<p>A user will be able to book appointments with coaches and book Indoor areas for their sport. When a user books a coach they can book them as a General inquiry where it would be similar to an introductory lesson where the user would get the general idea how and what will happen in their coaching sessions. They can book as a Personal training session where a user will be able to train 1-on-1 on fundamental skills of their chosen sports and Group training sessions where the user can train as part of a group and further enhance their Fundamentals and Team skills required for the sport. </p>
								<p>A user can also create teams and join teams for various sports at a Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced level. The App also maintains a leaderboard similar to the likes of Uber where a user can give other users a star rating so people can spend the limited time they may have for a sport optimally. A user can use in-app messaging to talk to and maintain contacts that they have met through the app. Ultimately, participating in a sport ‘Sports Hub’ will make it easier to Enter and easier to gain more knowledge about any chosen sports that are featured on the App. </p>
								<p></p>
								<h4 class="major">Topic</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/marvel1.PNG" alt="Logo" /></span>
								<p> ‘Sports Hub’ is designed for sports lovers, As in Australia more than 90% of adults have an interest in sports (Australian Government, Department of Health) but it seems hard to begin getting into sports as you get older. This app makes this process much easier. </p>
								<p> Community sport infrastructure is estimated to generate an annual value of more than 16.2 billion to Australia. With 6.3 billion worth of economic benefit (Australian Government: Australian Sports Commision, The Value of Community Sport Infrastructure, 2018) Making this app tap into a billion dollar market. </p>
								<p>(Australian Government, Department of Health) <br><a href="url">https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/sport</a><br></p>
								<p></p>
								<h4 class="major">Motivation</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/running1.png" alt="Logo" /></span>
								<p>‘Sports Hub’ gives people an outlet to be more active. In 2017–18, an estimated 2 in 3 (67%) Australians aged 18 and over were overweight or obese (36% were overweight but not obese, and 31% were obese). That’s around 12.5 million adults. (Australian Government: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Overweight and obesity, 2020). </p>
								<p>Almost 4 in 10 adults aged 18–64 (37%) reported Not enough time or Too many other commitments as the main barriers to participating in sport or recreational physical activities. As age increased, Poor health or injury was more frequently cited as the main barrier—increasing from almost one-fifth (18%) of those aged 35–44 to almost half (48%) of adults aged 65 and over. (Australian Government: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Physical activity across the life stages, pg.7). This app will make it easier to have enough time because it will be easier to track where to start from and reduce poor health or injury barrier by having an overall more healthy population as the App makes it easier to be active. </p>
								<p>This app uses models demonstrated by Uber and similar apps but pigeon-holes it to physical activity in particular sports and participating in them. A future employer will see this as an innovation combining coaching and team finding in the one App tapping into a profitable market. Ultimately showing that we are forward thinkers.</p>
								<p>(Australian Government: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Overweight and obesity, 2020) <br><a href="url">https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/australias-health/overweight-and-obesity</a><br> </p> 
								<p> </p>
								<h4 class="major">LandScape</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IOSicon.png" alt="Logo" /></span>
								<p> This app is similar to Uber in terms of how it works with map integration and reviewing purposes in order to help people complete the task of finding a sports team, club or coach optimally. In the market there’s an App called Teamer which finds Teams and an App called ‘Possible’ that finds Personal trainers. We can use these as guidelines to create our App that is unique to them both by hitting both markets and being an overall more accessible and encompassing version for users to interact with. </p>
